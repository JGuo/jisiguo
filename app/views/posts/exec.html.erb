		<p>I recently completed some design work for the folks at Exec, a service for on-demand labor. In this project, I focused on the brand identity and designed a splash page that would quickly communicate the value proposition. I used the frequently asked questions and common worry points as guidelines in crafting the story of the splash page. I really enjoyed this project, definitely looking forward to more work with a focus on brand identity and effective communication. </p>
