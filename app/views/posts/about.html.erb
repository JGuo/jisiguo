	<h1 class="post-title">Hi, I'm Jisi.</h1>
	<div class="post-body">
		<p>
			I'm an entrepreneur and product designer based in San Francisco, California. I specialize in user interface design, interaction design and user experience. I'm most interested in helping organizations craft simple and intuitive user experiences with software and hardware.
		</p>
		<p>
			My journey as a designer has been a winding road. As an undergraduate at Northwestern University, I focused on business theory, double majoring in industrial engineering and economics. I eventually discovered my passion for product design and enrolled in the masters program at Northwestern for user centered design. My multi disciplinary background has often offered me a unique vantage point in solving design problems and delivering delightful user experiences.

		<p>
			I've worked with large corporations as well as startups to address their product and design needs. At Accenture, I worked in the research & development lab, developing web and mobile applications. In 2011, I founded a community for Chicago entrepreneurs that is now a part of Built In Chicago. Most recently, I was the Head of Product at Ribbon, where I led user experience design and front-end development. Currently, I am working on projects as a freelance designer and developer.

			I am always interested in meeting new people and learning about new ideas. If you're interested in collaborating or just want to chat, please do get in touch.

			Cheers,<br/>
