		<p>Chicago Founders is a Q&A forum for Chicago entrepreneurs. The forum was designed to support the budding entrepreneurial community in Chicago. Members are able to ask and answer questions and use the forum as a platform for developing the Chicago startup community. Members are also able to chat in real-time, promoting discussion and networking opportunities.</p>

		<p>In 2012, Chicago Founders was acquired by Built In Chicago. Chicago Founders continues to serve the startup community as the Q&A forum within Built In Chicago. Built In Chicago has been a great catalyst in the city's development as a startup hub, and it is with great pleasure that I can collaborate with Built In Chicago to ensure Chicago's continued development.
